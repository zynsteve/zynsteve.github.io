## Adjustable Discriminant Rules
+ Both parametric and nonparametric classification rules are plug-in rules, that is, they involve some form of distribution estimation using training data.
+ We will consider now a different idea:
- Assume a set of discriminants (decision boundaries)
- Search for the discriminant that best fits the data by optimizing some objective criterion (“learning”)
+ This is the basic idea behind many popular “machine learning” classification rules:
Perceptrons, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks, Decision Trees
